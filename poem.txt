Throughout my life, my family has never failed to be there for me.
Good times and bad, they’ve never lost faith.
Without them, I wouldn’t  be a complete person.
They motivate me to be a better person everyday.
They bring light into my life,
and I hope I have them in my life forever. 
I’m thankful for my loved ones.
